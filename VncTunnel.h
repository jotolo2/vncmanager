/**
 * @brief a class that takes care of single VNC client.
 *
 * This class acts as VNC proxy that forwards VNC messages between its client and associated XvncConnection. It can switch the client from current to a new XvncConnection.
 * It also handles communication with greeter using GreeterConnection if one is displayed in current session.
 *
 * This class is meant to live in its own thread started by start() method. The thread quits and this class gets deleted when the client disconnects.
 *
 * @remark This class must be allocated with new operator. It owns itself and deletes itself at the end of start function.
 * @remark This class is not thread safe and is meant to be used inside its own thread.
